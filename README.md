# OpenCartAbstracta-cypress

This is a work in progress, as I am at the beginning of learning cypress. However, I decided to share it as a WIP to show my interest in test automation and the ability to learn independently.
Here are my plans to improve the tests shared here, which will appear as I learn more:
1.  Introduce global commands
2.  Divide .specs 
3.	Add more variety of tests (i.e. using different commands)
4.	Use variables instead of hardcoded values
5.	Use “before each” for repetitive steps
6.	Introduce Cucumber
7.	Write tests that change if the elements change on hover – if possible in Cypress
8.	Introduce using regular expressions in the tests

Other issues:
1.	When selecting an element of the page, I use its strict location. This is a bad practice, but since I have no influence on the page’s code and the elements only have such identifiers, I had to keep it like this.
